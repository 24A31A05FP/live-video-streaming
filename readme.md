# 🚀 Live Video Streaming Platform

---

## 📄 Project Description

A real-time **WebRTC-based Live Streaming Platform** built using **Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io, and WebRTC**.
This platform allows one streamer to broadcast live video and audio to multiple viewers simultaneously, with real-time chat support and a clean, responsive user interface.

## ❗ Problem Statement

However, building a low-latency, peer-to-peer live streaming system that supports multiple viewers with real-time interaction remains a technical challenge. This project addresses that gap by developing a lightweight, browser-based live video streaming platform using WebRTC and WebSocket technologies — eliminating the need for expensive third-party streaming services.
